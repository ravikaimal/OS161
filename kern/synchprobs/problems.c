 * You should implement your solution to the stoplight problem below. The
 * quadrant and direction mappings for reference: (although the problem is,
 * of course, stable under rotation)
 *
 *   | 0 |
 * --     --
 *    0 1
 * 3       1
 *    3 2
 * --     --
 *   | 2 | 
 *
 * As way to think about it, assuming cars drive on the right: a car entering
 * the intersection from direction X will enter intersection quadrant X
 * first.
 *
 * You will probably want to write some helper functions to assist
 * with the mappings. Modular arithmetic can help, e.g. a car passing
 * straight through the intersection entering from direction X will leave to
 * direction (X + 2) % 4 and pass through quadrants X and (X + 3) % 4.
 * Boo-yah.
 *
 * Your solutions below should call the inQuadrant() and leaveIntersection()
 * functions in drivers.c.
